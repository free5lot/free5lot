### Hi there!

I am a passionate Software Engineer who loves computers, `GNU/Linux` and `Free Software`.

Some of languages and technologies that I has been using: `C`, `C++`, `C#`, `PHP`, `Python`, `JS`/`HTML`/`CSS`, `Bash`/`Shell`, `Java`.

I use this account to publish my projects and provide limited support for them.

### Some of my FLOSS projects:

1. [Patch of hid-apple](https://github.com/free5lot/hid-apple-patched) - a patch for Linux kernel that became quite popular, according to its likes.
It allows to swap the Fn key and left Control key and a make some other keyboard tweaks on Macbook Pro and Apple keyboards in GNU/Linux.  
Some features of the patched version were sent upstream.
      
2. [Camera_Net]() - a library/component for `.NET` that allows to use Camera easily (via `DirectShow`).
It also became popular because of lack of proper and handy solutions to use camera in `.NET` in such a convenient way.  
You can read [my CodeProject article](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/671407/Camera-Net-Library) about this library for more details.

3. [CatalogFS](https://github.com/free5lot/catalogfs) - a `FUSE`-based filesystem for making and viewing indexes (snapshots) of backups and other data.
It allows to index backups and save state of directories without consuming too much disk-space. I made it because existing indexing solutions were not good enough.  
Best used with `CatalogFS_Lister` script.

4. [CatalogFS_Lister](https://github.com/free5lot/catalogfs_lister) - a `Python` script to make `CatalogFS` indexes faster and with some additional features, like checksum calculations.  
Best used with `CatalogFS` but can be used alone with decent results. `CatalogFS` filesystem and `CatalogFS_Lister` script, started in 2020, became publicly available in Jule 2022 after reaching 3.0 version with major file-format change.


All these projects were made just because I needed them, but I love that sharing them allowed a lot of people to use them and provide feedback for my work. Also I'd like to thank all contributors who were quite helpful.
